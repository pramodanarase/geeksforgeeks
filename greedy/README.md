# Greedy Method

A problem has multiple solution but few solution can satisfy constraint.

# Feasible Solution
few solution can satisfy constraint are called feasible solution.

# Optimal Solution
 - Problem either have minimum or maximum result
 - Only one solution
 
# Optimization Problem
- This required both minimum and maximum result
- only one solution
